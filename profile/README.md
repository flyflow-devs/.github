# Welcome to Flyflow ðŸ‘‹ ðŸš€

> Flyflow is high performance API middleware to optimize LLM applications, same response quality, 5x lower latency, secure, and much higher token limits

When building on top of LLMs, builders care about the following: 

- Response quality 
- Latency (both time to first token and tokens / second)
- Rate limits 
- Reliability
- Enterprise grade security

Flyflow is middleware designed to optimize for all of these qualities, built to be open source, high performance written in golang, and optionally self-hosted for maximum flexiblity.
